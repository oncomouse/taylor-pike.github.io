**Howdy!**

My name is Taylor Pike.

I am a senior Englsih major from Bentonville, Arkansas.

My favorite movie is The Sixth Sense.

My favorite type of music is Indie, especially by Phoebe Bridgers.

I love breakfast tacos.

I am on the Women's Swimming and Diving team for A&M.

I am taking this class because of my interest in blogging.

Although I have started my own blog, I would like to improve my skills and learn more about how to make my blog/site successful.

Also, I would like to become a writer in the future, and I know that digital writing is where the world is going.

I am excited to be in this course!
