This week, my classmates and I had to style our websites using CSS, a programming language that works with HTML to edit the stylized elements of a web page.

Although the information in Dr. Pilschâ€™s article for the week was clear and concise, I still struggled to apply these ideas on my actual website. I wanted, as Dr. Pilsch had done, to put my menu on the left side bar. 

To be honest, I had no idea how to do this at first. Moving the actual content to one side of the screen or another seemed like a completely foreign concept to me.

So I contacted Dr. Pilsch via Microsoft Teams to ask for any advice. He gave me a clearer explanation of how to create this side menu. I was then able to message him any other questions I had about the concepts and ideas in forming this code.

After gaining a full understanding of the process of using CSS to create this side bar menu, I was able to apply what I learned to make it happen.
