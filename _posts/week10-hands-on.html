	"origin": "Angela had been missing for three days. Despite constant searching by her family, friends and all the police in the area, there was no sign of her anywhere. The only clue that remained was a note tucked beneath her pillow which read “Don’t come looking for me.”
    Angela’s parents were hysterical. Neither they nor her friends knew of any reason she would take off, and they certainly didn’t know anybody that would want to cause her any harm. As the days passed with no progress, some were starting to give up hope. That is until her parents got a mysterious call.
    It was 4:00 in the morning, 76 hours since Angela had been reported missing, when the phone rang. Her parents quickly picked up the phone, desperate for any updates on her daughter’s whereabouts. But instead of the police, a strange man answered.
    “If you want to know where your daughter is, meet me at the park at 11:00 tomorrow night. And if you tell anyone about it, she’ll be dead before dawn.” 
    Angela’s father tried to ask the man who he was, but before he could, the man was gone. Angela’s mother broke into tears, and her father pulled her towards him to console her. “What are we going to do?” she asked between sobs.
    The man sighed. “There’s only one thing we can do.”

		"“We’ve got to meet this man. You heard what he said. If we don’t, he’ll kill her.”
    “But what if it’s a trap?” her mother cried. “What if she’s already dead and he’s just looking to kill someone else?”
    He grasped her by the shoulders and stared deeply into her eyes. “That’s just a risk we’re going to have to take. For Angela.”
    She wiped her eyes and sniffled. “For Angela.”
    The following day passed slowly, the tension rising with each passing minute. Neither slept as the time passed as each of them yearned for 11:00 to arrive, while simultaneously wishing it would never come.
	  Finally, it was time to meet the mysterious caller at the park. Angela’s father grabbed his keys and placed them in his back pocket, right next to the gun he had hidden in his pants.
    The couple arrived and parked discreetly under a few trees. After a few minutes, they noticed a man walking near the playground. They hesitantly exited their car and walked towards him.
    They inched closer to the man, the father keeping one hand on the gun, the other in front of his wife, keeping her out of harm’s way.
    When the man began to hear their footsteps, he spun around, gripping Angela around the waste with a gun held to her head. Her parents gasped and were stopped in their tracks. For a moment, only silence was heard between the two pairs, no sounds except the stifled cries of Angela against the choke in her mouth.
    “Please,” her father said. “Just give her back to us.”
    The man laughed coldly. “I know you’re not that stupid. If you want her, you’ll need to pay.”
    “We’ll do anything!” her mother blurted out, the horror of the moment getting the best of her.
    “What do you want?” her father asked, more calm and collected.
    “One hundred thousand dollars,” he said firmly.
    Angela’s father cringed, but her mother quickly opened her purse, searching for her checkbook. She hastily wrote out the amount and handed it over to the man who snatched it away.
    “Now give her to us,” her father said.
    His dark laugh returned, a spine-chilling chuckle. “I don’t think so. It’s time to finish what I’ve started.” He cocked the gun and Angela let out a horrified shriek.

    "“We have to tell the police.”
    “But what about his message?” his wife exclaimed. “He said he would kill her if we told anyone.”
    He sighed. “They’re our best chance at getting our daughter back alive. We have to take the chance and pray that everything works out.”
    After a long morning at the police station, the couple waited impatiently for the approaching hour of truth. They knew they would simply have to wait by the phone when the time came, hoping they would get news of their daughter’s safety.
    Soon, the clock on the wall read 11:00 PM and the two held their breath. Suddenly, catching them both off-guard, the phone on the wall rang. Angela’s father caught his wife’s eyes for a moment before taking a deep breath and picking up the phone.
    “Hello?”

    "Before he could think, Angela’s father pulled his own gun from his back pocket, and the stranger was suddenly face down in the dirt in a pool of his own blood.
    Angela ran over to her parents. Her mother took her in her arms as they cried. Her father, after steadying his shaking hands, dropped the gun in the grass and embraced his family, eventually picking up his daughter and letting his tears fall into her shirt, stained with the dead man’s blood.", 
    "Her father froze in place, as if he was momentarily paralyzed by the commotion. All too late did he reach back into his back pocket to grab his gun. As he heard his own shot ring through the air, he knew that it would never make it to its final destination in time.
    In the blink of an eye, both the strange man and his daughter were lying on the ground, floating in a pool of their mixed blood.
    “No!” he cried through blinding tears. He ran over to his daughter, shoving the dead man away. He picked up her lifeless body, her blood staining his hands to a dark crimson. He pulled her body into his own in a forced embrace, praying each sob he gave would bring her back.
    And it was only the sounds of their grief, his cries over what remained of his little girl and the uncontrollable wails of his wife, face down in the dirt, that were heard through the park when midnight struck."]

    "“Mr. Jones?” the voice asked.
    “This is he,” he answered quickly.
    “We found your daughter…” he trailed off.
    “Well, is she okay?” He was becoming frantic.
    “I’m afraid she’s dead. We found her body here in the park. There’s a note on her body that reads ‘You’ve gotta follow the rules.’ I’m really sorry Mr. Jones.”
    But he hadn’t heard any of this. The sobs of his wife rang in his ears as the phone dropped onto the ground and he stared, frozen, at the clock on the wall, at the hands that had seemingly stopped moving.", 
    "“What did I say about telling anyone else?”
	Shivers went down his spine. It was the same voice as the night before. The father was speechless, stuttering incoherently into the phone.
	“I guess we’ll just have to do it you’re way then,” said the voice. But this time it wasn’t on the phone. It was right beside them, a strange man in their kitchen, holding their daughter with a gun to her head.
	His wife shrieked, but Angela’s father stood up slowly, his hands up in surrender.
	“Please,” he whispered. “Take whatever you want, but let our daughter go.”
	“One hundred thousand dollars,” said the man robotically.
	The father quickly turned, searching frantically for their checkbook. After scribbling down the numbers, he handed the check to the man who quickly snatched it.
	The stranger lifted the gun from Angela’s head, now pointing it at her father. “Now you go stand in this corner of the room.” The gun followed him as he walked across to the kitchen table.
	“I’m going to leave this house, and I’m taking your daughter with me. If you try anything, I’ll bust your brains out then put the gun on her.”
	“No!” The father cried, the gun still pointed at his head.
	The stranger made a sinister laugh. “Did you really think I was going to let her-“
	Suddenly, an explosion sounded in the room. The man’s head burst open, blood spewing all over the walls. Angela shrieked in horror. The man fell to the ground, and the room was silent. The father rose his head to follow the bullet’s trail.
	There, across the room, was his wife, a gun in hand still pointed at their daughter’s attacker. Her arms shook and she stayed like that for a moment, afraid but ready without hesitation to shoot again.
	When it was clear that they were safe, Angela ran to her mother who had dropped the gun on the ground and embraced her closely.
	Her father walked over, amazed at his wife’s attack, but nonetheless thankful as he held his family close."]
